This repository includes Python scripts and GEE Scripts that I wrote in order to conduct pre-processing steps as well as filtering using Pandas; to tune the parameters for my Random Forest classification and to plot the data & results. 

## Python Scripts: 
* ### 1) Mongo DB Queries 
     * Scripts to query from PEAT's database for different locations and timeframes

* ### 2) Data preprocessing 
     * Scripts to clean up and filter data using Pandas Module

* ### 3) Cropnet testing 
     * Preprocessing 
     * Summary statistic
     
* ### 4) Random Forest Parameter Tuning 
     * Grid Search
     * OOB error plot
     * OOB error score
     * Random Forest feature importance

* ### 5) Time series plots
     * Submissions per day and year
     
* ### 6) Bar plots
     * Location accuracy within predefined ranges
     
* ### 5) Boxplots
     * User accuracy and producer accuracy per zone
